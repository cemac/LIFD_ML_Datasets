# How to find and use CMIP6 data in the CEDA Archive

A quickstart guide to finding a CMIP6 dataset on the CEDA Archive and using it
within JASMIN.

In summary:
* CMIP6 data has a very specific naming convention
* The data is stored on JASMIN under `/badc/cmip6/`
* However, it's often easier to find CMIP6 data through a web-based interface first
* Not all CMIP6 data is on JASMIN â€“ if the data you need isn't there, you might
  be able to download it into your project's Group Workspace so your entire team
  can access it
