## CMIP6 Data Hackathon<br>2–4 June 2021

The Climate Modelling Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) Data Hackathon is a
3-day hackathon event, organised by the University of Bristol's Jean Golding
Institute and Cabot Institute on behalf of the Bristol, Exeter, Leeds and UCL
Met Office Academic Partnerships (MOAP). Over the course of the event, teams of
academic researchers from across the UK will work on research questions set by
the MOAP partners related to weather and climate and CMIP6 data. We encourage
contributions specifically from early career researchers, including PhDs and
Postdocs.

Please see our webpage (https://cmip6moap.github.io) for details of the projects
submitted.

Closing date for applications is [16 April 2021].
