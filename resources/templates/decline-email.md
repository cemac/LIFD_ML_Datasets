Subject: CMIP6 Data Hackathon â€“ sorry we can't offer you a place

Dear Applicant,

Thank you for applying to take part in the [CMIP6 Data Hackathon] hosted by the
Universities of Bristol, Exeter, Leeds, UCL and the Met Office.

Unfortunately, we can't offer you a place because [we were only able to consider
applicants from UK-based academic institutions].

Thank you for your interest and we wish you all the best with your research
activities.

Kind regards,

The CMIP6 Data Hackathon Committee
