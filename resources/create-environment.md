# A guide to setting up a custom python environment on JASMIN using conda

How to install and use specific versions of python packages in your own
environment, allowing your team to use consistent versions of packages across
all your analysis on JASMIN, helping ensure reproducibility of your work.

In summary:
* We provide a pre-installed environment specifically for the hackathon which
  contains up-to-date versions of the most common packages
* If we've missed something, we'll also do our best to add it for you
* All you need to do is run one command to *install a kernel* in the Notebook
  Service, then this will be available to all your notebooks
* You can also create your own environment if you need specific versions of
  packages
