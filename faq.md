## What do we mean by an Early Career Researcher (ECR)?

We include PhDs and Postdocs in this definition, however we don’t want to
specify people a fixed number of years into their career, because that wouldn’t
be fair on people that work part-time, have taken time off or years in industry.
If you feel you meet the definition of an ECR, then that’s good enough for us!
